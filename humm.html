            <h2 class="projectdescription">This is a live product designed for Humm Neuroscience. Humm is a company building a consumer-grade wearable device, backed by leading neuroscience conducted at UCSF, that gently stimulates the prefrontal cortex to improve an individual’s working memory by 20%. In early 2019, Humm introduced a company rebrand better tailored to their older target market. A critical component of the company rebrand required redesigning the Humm website to embody a premium brand for people passionate about their growth, learning, and health.</h2>

        <h1 class="titles">1. DEFINING THE PROBLEM SPACE</h1>
        <p>A teardown and usability testing of Humm’s initial website revealed that users did not feel as though the website provided an adequate amount of scientific information, customer traction, and company accountability. Information was poorly organized and often hard to find.</p>

        <h1 class="titles">2. USER PERSONAS</h1>
        <p>In this website redesign, personas became an incredibly important part of the design process because we were still figuring out who our target users were. Our personas gave us a means of synthesizing our user research data into promising target market groups, and were consistently used as an alignment tool to make more informed decisions around branding and content writing.</p>
        <img src="images/hummpersona.png" alt="hummpersona">
        <p>Things that should be kept in mind for the effective use of personas in the future would be to include stakeholders and end users in our research sessions to help us better define persona attributes. Moreover, our team relied primarily on broad scope personas. However, creating targeted scope personas would have allowed us to more deeply understand the impact of certain interaction design decisions.</p>

        <h1 class="titles">4. DESIGN CHALLENGES AND CONSTRAINTS</h1>
        <p>Throughout our design process, we had limited access to users within our target market. Although individuals between the ages of 50 and 70 could be contacted through online platforms such as Craigslist and Nextdoor, we struggled to find avenues of access to viable research participants and often had to reach out to friends of family members or local organization such as the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute. Nonetheless, five usability tests were conducted on our initial mid-fidelity wireframes. Feedback from these usability tests revealed that there was still a lack of trust from our users in both the effectiveness of the product and the competency of our team. We decided to focus on building this trust by including credible news sources that featured Humm's product, displaying more intuitive graphics and data visualizations, as well as giving customers more of an opportunity to engage with our team by signing up for company newsletters.</p>

          <p>This website redesign played a large role in helping the company improve customer traction and trust. The new Humm website was also presented to investors and became a contributing factor to Humm raising a $2.5M seed. Through this website redesign, the company was able to align around a stronger, more intentially branded story of how our product would fit into the daily lives of our target users. In future iterations of the Humm website, opportunities for improvement include reducing and simplifying the website copy, improving navigation of information within and between pages, as well as evaluating and iterating on the website with regards to accessibility.</p>
